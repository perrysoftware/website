BrokeLife is a project that I did for my Software Engineering class at Purdue Fort Wayne in my junior year. We chose groups of four people and chose a project to take on for the semester.
The first part of the class has been dedicated to requirement analysis and planning, diagrams, and prototyping. We did presentations at the end of each month to show our progress.
We made the project in Java and using GitHub to collaborate together.">
