      <description>Senior Capstone Project Purdue Fort Wayne 2020-2021
Problem Statement As a team, we want to correlate the symptoms of dementia to data, by researching said symptoms and the data that pertains to each symptom, to then be analyzed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Once all symptoms are mapped to data that can be analyzed by AI, we will implement a prototype system to cover the collection of data. This data will pertain to said symptoms to the best of our ability given the availability of sensor technology at this time.</description>

Shaves and Fades is a website that I made with a small group for a class my junior year of college. It is a simple website for a local barbershop. We got to practice using Node and Express. I worked on a protype scheduling system that is not in use.</description>

BrokeLife is a project that I did for my Software Engineering class at Purdue Fort Wayne in my junior year. We chose groups of four people and chose a project to take on for the semester.
The first part of the class has been dedicated to requirement analysis and planning, diagrams, and prototyping. We did presentations at the end of each month to show our progress.
We made the project in Java and using GitHub to collaborate together.</description>
