      <description>Hello! My name is Brendan Perry. I love God, have an incredible family of four, and enjoy watching the St. Louis Cardinals.
I am a software engineer who loves to build things. I have experience in mobile development with iOS, Android, and Xamarin, as well as back-end development in .NET.
My desire to learn new technology and tackle fun projects has driven my journey in software. I have always enjoyed playing video games and wanted to learn how to create my own.</description>
