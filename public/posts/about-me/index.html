In my first job out of college, I worked in consulting, where I talked directly to clients to solve complex problems. This experience showed me that building good software is more than just writing code. While it is fun to write out all the technologies and frameworks that I have experience with, the truth is that there will always be more to learn.

This skill is something that I have proven that I excel at and really enjoy doing.\nIn August 2023, I released Sporadic. Sporadic is an iOS app made with Swift and SwiftUI. It was a fun app idea that my brother and I thought up one summer afternoon. Now, I use it daily. Since my start on Sporadic, I have also worked extensively with Swift and Swift UI at work, where I have come to really enjoy iOS and macOS development.\nIn addition to the apps that I have made, I have also worked on several back-end systems.
