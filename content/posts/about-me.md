Hello! My name is Brendan Perry. I love God, have an incredible family of four, and enjoy watching the St. Louis Cardinals. 

I am a software engineer who loves to build things. I have experience in mobile development with iOS, Android, and Xamarin, as well as back-end development in .NET. 

My desire to learn new technology and tackle fun projects has driven my journey in software. I have always enjoyed playing video games and wanted to learn how to create my own. In middle school, I began learning how to code in C# to create a game in Unity. Fast forward to today, and I have published seven games made with Unity on the iOS App Store. This experience taught me a lot of things. Most notably, I learned how much I enjoy creating things with software.

What was a fun hobby turned into a career, and I am continuing to grow as a software engineer. In my first job out of college, I worked in consulting, where I talked directly to clients to solve complex problems. This experience showed me that building good software is more than just writing code. While it is fun to write out all the technologies and frameworks that I have experience with, the truth is that there will always be more to learn. What is most important is one's ability and willingness to learn and use that new knowledge to solve problems. This skill is something that I have proven that I excel at and really enjoy doing.

In August 2023, I released Sporadic. Sporadic is an iOS app made with Swift and SwiftUI. It was a fun app idea that my brother and I thought up one summer afternoon. Now, I use it daily. Since my start on Sporadic, I have also worked extensively with Swift and Swift UI at work, where I have come to really enjoy iOS and macOS development.

In addition to the apps that I have made, I have also worked on several back-end systems. Some technologies include server-side Swift, .NET, and NestJS.

I also have a passion for open-source and privacy-respecting software. I am also interested in Linux development and have created one small app using Vala for ElementaryOS. I plan to dive deeper into this area in the future.

I am thankful to God for all the opportunities that I have been given and the fun projects that I have been involved in. I look forward to learning more in the future, and I am excited for new challenges that come my way.
