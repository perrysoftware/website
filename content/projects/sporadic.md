Sporadic is my latest published iOS project. It is a simple app that gives you random workouts throughout the week.
It is a native iOS app built with Swift UI. I took on this project to learn how to build non-game apps. I have learned a lot about Swift, Swift UI, and iOS in general. This includes things such as local notifications, swapping app icons, and light/dark mode switching."
