Simple Stocks is a stocks app built for Elementary OS with GTK and Vala. It is my first Linux desktop app. I made this app because I wanted an app like this myself.

My goal was to learn about building Linux apps as that is the directly I would like to go with my career in general. I want to contribute back to the community with free open source software.

Since then, I have started using Arch, so I would like to learn how to package this app for other distros. In the future, I want to make an app using Qt and C++ as well.
